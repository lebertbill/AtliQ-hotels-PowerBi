# AtliQ Hospitality Analysis | PowerBi

## Problem statement
AtliQ Grands, with a prominent presence in India's hospitality sector for two decades, operates multiple five-star hotels. Despite their longstanding reputation, they're witnessing a decline in market share and revenue within the luxury/business hotels segment, partly due to competitive strategies and management decisions. To counter this trend, the managing director seeks to leverage "Business and Data Intelligence" as a strategic initiative to reclaim their market position and revenue streams. However, the company lacks an internal data analytics team capable of delivering the necessary insights.
